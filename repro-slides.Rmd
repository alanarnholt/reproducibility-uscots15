# Reproduciblity: who cares?


## Seizure study retracted after authors realize data got "terribly mixed"

From the authors of **Low Dose Lidocaine for Refractory Seizures in Preterm Neonates**:

*"The article has been retracted at the request of the authors. After carefully re-examining the data presented in the article, they identified that data of two different hospitals got terribly mixed. The published results cannot be reproduced in accordance with scientific and clinical correctness."*

## Bad spreadsheet merge kills depression paper, quick fix resurrects it

* The authors informed the journal that the merge of lab results and other survey data used in the paper resulted in an error regarding the identification codes. Results of the analyses were based on the data set in which this error occurred. Further analyses established the results reported in this manuscript and interpretation of the data are not correct. 

* **Original conclusion:** Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with current depression and with future depression [...].

* **Revised conclusion:** Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with current depression [...].

## Author retracts study of changing minds on same-sex marriage after colleague admits data were faked

* One of the authors of a recent study that claimed that short conversations with gay people could change minds on same-sex marriage has retracted it.

* Researchers wanting to replicate the study failed to find such impressive results in their survey, and the study was retracted due to data having been faked.

* Methods we will be discussing today won't prevent against data being faked, but they will make it easier and quicker to spot when such fraud is happening.

# Exercise 1: Motivating reproducibility

## Instructions

**Part 1:** *Analyze + document*

* Load `data/gapminder-5060.csv` into your statistical analysis package of choice, and complete the following exercise. Write instructions/documentation for your collaborator to reproduce your.

* **Task:** Visualize the relationship between GDP and life expectancy for countries in Europe in 1952.

**Part 2:** *Swap + discuss*

* Swap instructions/documentation with your collaborator, and reproduce their work without any additional instructions. Software mismatch: help them install the necessary software, or walk them through it on your computer to emulate the experience.

* Then, discuss challenges you faced (or didn't face) and why you were or weren't able to reproduce their work.

* Have you ever tried to reproduce someone else's data analysis before?
* Have you ever tried to reproduce your own work before?
* What made it easy/hard for reproducing your parners' work?
* What would have to happen if you had to extend the analysis further?
* If you caught a data error how easy/hard would it be to re-create the analysis?
* What would happen if your collaborator is no longer available to walk you through their analysis?


# Literate programming

## Donald Knuth. "Literate Programming (1984)" 

*in Literate Programming. CSLI, 1992, pg. 99.*

"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do."

"The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what each variable means. He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce each other."

Many years but tools haven't been around

## Ambitious goal + (most likely) novice students

We need an environment where

* reproducibility is built in
    * the original data remains untouched
    * all data manipulations and analyses are inherently documented

* documentation is human readable and syntax is minimal

## Toolkit

<div class="columns-2">
![R](img/Rlogo-1.png)

![RStudio](img/RStudio-Logo-Blue-Gradient.png)
</div>

all in one, as lightweight as possible

## Why R?

<div class="columns-2">
* Programming language for data analysis
* Free!
* Open source
* Widely used and supported across all disciplines
* Can be used on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux

![RSplash](img/RSplash.png)
</div>

## Why not language X?

* There are a number of other great programming tools out there that can also be used to improve the reproducibility of your analysis

* The key is to use some type of language that will allow you to automate and document your analysis

* Once you master one language you'll probably find it easier to learn another


## Why RStudio?

* RStudio $\ne$ R, it's instead an integrated development environment (IDE) for R

* Gives you a single environment to combine your documentation and your analysis with markdown support
* Runs on top of R
* Gives you a bunch of really cool features, some of which we'll explore throughout the workshop


## Anatomy of RStudio

<center>

</center>


## Anatomy of RStudio (cont.)

* Left: Console
    * Every time you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the console telling you the version of R that you’re running. 
    * Below that information is the prompt. 
    
* Upper right: workspace and a history of the commands that you've previously entered

* Lower right: Any plots that you generate + access to files, help, packages

## Tying back to literate programming

RStudio + RMarkdown = Literate programming in R


# A reproducible framework

## Four facets of reproducibility

* **Documentation:** difference between binary (e.g. docx) and plain text files, and why text files are preferred for documentation + using markdown to document your workflow so that anyone can pick up your data and follow what you are doing

* **Organization:** tools for organizing your projects so that you don't have a single folder with hundreds of files

* **Automation:** the power of scripting in the R programming language and integrating it into RMarkdown to create automated data analyses

* **Dissemination:** publishing is not the end of your analysis, rather it is a way station towards your future research and the future research of others

# Revisit Exercise 1: Doing better

## Getting started

**Option 1: I'm new to R/RStudio:**

* Use the URL and login information provided on the paper slip to log in to RStudio Server
* Upload repro-ex.zip by clicking on *Upload* in the *Files* pane (RStudio will automatically unzip the folder)
* Click on the folder *repro-ex* and open the file *ex1-template.Rmd*

**Option 2: I already use R/RStudio:** Do you have the **latest** versions of R and RStudio installed locally on your computer?

* If no, go to Option 1
* If yes, open *ex1-template.Rmd* in RStudio
* Also make sure you have the `knitr` and `ggplot2` packages installed and loaded

## Demo

[Walkthrough of the `ex1-template.Rmd` document and output]


## A brief extension

```{r echo=FALSE}
gap_5060 = read.csv("data/gapminder-5060.csv")
library(ggplot2)
```

**Task:** Add year 1967 in another color.

* Create a subset of `gap_5060` for Europe in 1952 and 1967:
```{r eval=FALSE}
years = c(1952, 1967)
eu_5267 = subset(gap_5060, continent == "Europe" & (year %in% years))
```

* Create the plot:
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = eu_5267, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_point()
```


# Exercise 2: Extending your analysis

## Resources

* Open `ex2-template.Rmd`


## Instructions

It's your lucky day, you just got some additional data!

**Tasks:**

1. Append the new data `gapminder-7080.csv` and `gapminder-90plus.csv` to your existing data set. (Be careful as you do so, as the ordering of columns in the data set may not match between the different CSV files!)

2. Create line plots of life expectancy over time for Canada, Mexico, and the United States that run from 1952 to 2007.


## Demo

[Walkthrough of the `ex2-template.Rmd` document and output]


## Further extensions

**Task:** Create the same plot as before, but now also include data from Cambodia, China, Japan, Egypt, South Africa, Uganda.


## Take aways

* The analysis is self-documenting

* It's easy to extend or refine analyses by copying and modifying code blocks

* The analysis can be disseminated by providing the RMarkdown file and data sources

* The results can also be shared as HTML (fully self contained), PDF, or Word (gasp!) if just a summary of the analysis is needed

# Reproducibility in the classroom

* in the intro class single markdown file
    * Lab example
    * success story from duke
    * to be successful:
        * well written labs
        * organized templates
    * added benefit: code output in one place makes learning easier
* in higher level classes can get into tools like GitHub etc., RStudio integration makes it easy


# Next steps

## Version control and git

* version control
* GitHub - everything is plain text
* integrates well with RStudio
* show GitHub page for workshop materials

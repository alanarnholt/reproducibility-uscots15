Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Click the **Knit** button to run embedded R chunks in the document:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
         geom_point()
```
